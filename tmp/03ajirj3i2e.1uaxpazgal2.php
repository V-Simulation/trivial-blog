        <h1>Hi, I&#39;m Nguyen Van Dung.</h1>
I graduated from Hanoi University of Science with the Degree of BSc in the field of Material Science. Until January 2015, I've been a Master student in Department of Physics, Hanyang University. Which means i do research, like a rookie. I also like to write code, all kinds, but mostly PHP and Matlab.
