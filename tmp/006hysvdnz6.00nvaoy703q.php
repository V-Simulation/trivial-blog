        <h1>Hi, I&#39;m Nguyen Van Dung.</h1>
I graduated from Hanoi University of Science with the Degree of BSc in the field of Material Science. Until January 2015, I've been a Master student in Department of Physics, Hanyang University. Which means i do research, like a rookie with a limit of <a href="<?php echo @$BASE; ?>/publications">publications</a>. I also like to write code, all kinds, but mostly Matlab and PHP. 
<p></p>

After 1 year living in Korea, working with brilliant people, it changed my life a lot.	

<p>
It's not much, but I wrote some personal stories to kill free time. It has been <a href="archives">archived</a>.</p>
<h2>I&#39;m, like, all over the Internets</h2>
